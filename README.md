Use java.

Calculate the actual throughput for 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax and for all available data rates, for both UDP and TCP.

‚Ä¢ Your program should accept 3 arguments:

  ‚Ä¢ Protocol (UDP/TCP)
  
  ‚Ä¢ Standard (802.11a, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.11ac_w1, 802.11ac_w2, 802.11ax)
  
  ‚Ä¢ Available data rate for each standard (e.g. 802.11a/g: 54, 48, 36,‚Ä¶)
  
  ‚Ä¢ Note: For standard .11n/ac, consider SDur = 3.6ùúás only
  
‚Ä¢ Your program must return for each scenario:

  ‚Ä¢ The actual throughput [Mbps] in the normal case (20MHz and 1SS) AND the best case:
  
   ‚Ä¢ 40MHz/4SS for .11n
   
   ‚Ä¢ 80MHz/3SS for .11ac_w1 ; 160MHz/8SS for .11ac_w2
   
   ‚Ä¢ 160MHz/8SS for .11ax
   
  ‚Ä¢ The amount of time needed to transfer 10 GB of data.
  
  
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúReadme‚Äù file ‚Äì detailing usage, and explaining:

  ‚Ä¢ Why there is a difference between the actual throughput and the advertised data rate.
  
  ‚Ä¢ 802.11 performance improves after each release. Briefly discuss the trade-offs involved in such improvements.
